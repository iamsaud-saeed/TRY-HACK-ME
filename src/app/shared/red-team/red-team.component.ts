Just like in a game of tag, the bad guys try to find ways to break into computer systems, and the good guys work hard to stop them. As the bad guys come up with new tricks, the good guys have to come up with new ways to protect against them. Sometimes, we use tests to check if our computers are safe from the bad guys. These tests are like quizzes for our computers. They help us find weaknesses in our defenses. But sometimes, these tests don't show us everything the bad guys could do. So they might not be enough to prepare us for a real attack from someone who's really determined to break in."

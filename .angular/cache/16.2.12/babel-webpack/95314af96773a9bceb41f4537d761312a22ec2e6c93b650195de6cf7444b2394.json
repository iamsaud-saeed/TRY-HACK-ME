As the bad guys come up with new tricks, the good guys have to come up with new ways to protect against them. Sometimes, we use tests to check if our computers are safe from the bad guys. These tests are like quizzes for our computers. They help us find weaknesses in our defenses. But sometimes, these tests don't show us everything the bad guys could do.

To this end,\n                        concessions may be made to meet this goal effectively. For example, the attacker's machine may\n                        be allowed listed on the available security solutions to avoid interfering with the\n                        vulnerability discovery process. This makes sense since the objective is to look at every host\n                        on the network and evaluate its security posture individually while providing the most\n                        information to the company about where to focus its remediation efforts.\n                        In simple words, a vulnerability check looks at each computer by itself to find problems.

To this end,\n                        concessions may be made to meet this goal effectively. For example, the attacker's machine may\n                        be allowed listed on the available security solutions to avoid interfering with the\n                        vulnerability discovery process. This makes sense since the objective is to look at every host\n                        on the network and evaluate its security posture individually while providing the most\n                        information to the company about where to focus its remediation efforts.\n                        In simple words, a vulnerability check looks at each computer by itself to find problems. This\n                        helps us figure out what needs fixing first to keep our network safe from bad guys. We mostly\n                        use tools that do this automatically, so anyone can do it without needing to know a lot about\n                        computers..</div>\n                    <img src=\"../../../assets/images/image.png\" class=\"img-fluid w-100\" style=\"margin: auto\">\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                <h2 class=\"accordion-header\" id=\"flush-headingThree\">\n                    <button class=\"accordion-button collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\"\n                        data-bs-target=\"#flush-collapseThree\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"flush-collapseThree\">\n                        Penetration Testing:\n                    </button>\n                </h2>\n                <div id=\"flush-collapseThree\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"flush-headingThree\"\n                    data-bs-parent=\"#accordionFlushExample\">\n                    <div class=\"accordion-body\">On top of scanning every single host for vulnerabilities, we often need\n                        to understand how they impact our network as a whole. Penetration tests add to vulnerability\n                        assessments by allowing the pentester to explore the impact of an attacker on the overall\n                        network by doing additional steps that include:\n                        Trying to take advantage of the weaknesses found on each system is crucial. Sometimes, a\n                        weakness might be there, but other protections stop it from being used by bad actors. This also\n                        helps us check if we can use the found weaknesses to get into a particular computer.\n                        After breaking into a computer, we do more tasks to see if we can get any useful information\n                        from it or if we can use it to get into other computers that we couldn't reach before.\n                        Penetration tests might start by scanning for vulnerabilities just as a regular vulnerability\n                        assessment but provide further information on how an attacker can chain vulnerabilities to\n                        achieve specific goals. While its focus remains on identifying vulnerabilities and establishing\n                        measures to protect the network, it also considers the network as a whole ecosystem and how an\n                        attacker could profit from interactions between its components.\n                        By analyzing how an attacker could move around our network, we also gain a basic insight on\n                        possible security measure bypasses and our ability to detect a real threat actor to a certain\n                        extent, limited because the scope of a penetration test is usually extensive and Penetration\n                        testers don't care much about being loud or generating lots of alerts on security devices since\n                        time constraints on such projects often requires us to check the network in a short time..</div>\n                    <img src=\"../../../assets/images/penetrationTesting.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"img-fluid w-100\"\n                        style=\"margin: auto\">\n                </div>\n\n            </div>\n\n            <!-- Repeat for items 4-7 -->\n\n            <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                <h2 class=\"accordion-header\" id=\"flush-headingFour\">\n                    <button class=\"accordion-button collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\"\n                        data-bs-target=\"#flush-collapseFour\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"flush-collapseFour\">\n                        Advanced Persistent Threats and why Regular Pentesting is not enough:\n                    </button>\n                </h2>\n                <div id=\"flush-collapseFour\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"flush-headingFour\"\n                    data-bs-parent=\"#accordionFlushExample\">\n                    <div class=\"accordion-body\">Even though the usual security methods we talked about help find many\n                        technical weaknesses, they still have some limits in fully getting a company ready to face a\n                        real attacker.

This helps us see how well our defenders can catch us and\n                        stop us. They don't replace regular tests but work together with them to focus more on catching\n                        and stopping attacks instead of just preventing them\n                        Red teaming is a term borrowed from the military. In military exercises, a group would take the\n                        role of a red team to simulate attack techniques to test the reaction capabilities of a\n                        defending team, generally known as blue team, against known adversary strategies. Translated\n                        into the world of cybersecurity, red team engagements consist of emulating a real threat actor's\n                        <b>Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs)</b> so that we can measure how well our blue team\n                        responds\n                        to them and ultimately improve any security controls in place.\n                        Every red team engagement will start by defining clear goals, often referenced as crown jewels\n                        or flags, ranging from compromising a given critical host to stealing some sensitive information\n                        from the target. Usually, the blue team won't be informed of such exercises to avoid introducing\n                        any biases in their analysis. The red team will do everything they can to achieve the goals\n                        while remaining undetected and evading any existing security mechanisms like firewalls,\n                        antivirus, EDR, IPS and others. Notice how on a red team engagement, not all of the hosts on a\n                        network will be checked for vulnerabilities. A real attacker would only need to find a single\n                        path to its goal and is not interested in performing noisy scans that the blue team could\n                        detect.\n                        Red team engagements also improve on regular penetration tests by considering several attack\n                        surfaces:\n                        <li> <b>Technical Infrastructure:</b> </li>\n                        Like in a regular penetration test, a red team will try to uncover\n                        technical vulnerabilities, with a much higher emphasis on stealth and evasion.\n                        <li> <b>Social Engineering:</b></li> Targeting people through phishing campaigns, phone calls or\n                        social\n                        media to\n                        trick them into revealing information that should be private.\n                        <li> <b>Physical Intrusion:</b> </li> Using techniques like lockpicking, RFID cloning,\n                        exploiting\n                        weaknesses in\n                        electronic access control devices to access restricted areas of facilities.\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                <h2 class=\"accordion-header\" id=\"flush-headingSix\">\n                    <button class=\"accordion-button collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\"\n                        data-bs-target=\"#flush-collapseSix\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"flush-collapseSix\">\n                        Teams and Functions of an engagments:\n                    </button>\n                </h2>\n                <div id=\"flush-collapseSix\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"flush-headingSix\"\n                    data-bs-parent=\"#accordionFlushExample\">\n                    <div class=\"accordion-body\">\n                        In a red team engagement, different people and factors come into play.

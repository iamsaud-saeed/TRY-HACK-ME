So they might not be enough to prepare us for a real attack from someone who's really determined to break in.\"\n    },\n\n\n  ]\n\n}\n","<div class=\"container \">\n    <div class=\"parent-margin\">\n        <div class=\"accordion accordion-flush\" id=\"accordionFlushExample\">\n            <div class=\"accordion-item\">\n                <h2 class=\"accordion-header\" id=\"flush-headingOne\">\n                    <button class=\"accordion-button collapsed\" type=\"button\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\"\n                        data-bs-target=\"#flush-collapseOne\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"flush-collapseOne\">\n                        Introduction:\n                    </button>\n                </h2>\n                <div id=\"flush-collapseOne\" class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"flush-headingOne\"\n                    data-bs-parent=\"#accordionFlushExample\">\n                    <div class=\"accordion-body\">Placeholder content for this accordion, which is intended to demonstrate\n                        the <code>.accordion-flush</code> class.

The red team can adapt this idea to map adversary TTPs (Tactics,\\u00A0Techniques, and\\u00A0Procedures) to components of an engagement. Many regulation and standardization bodies have released their cyber kill chain. Each kill chain follows roughly the same structure, with some going more in-depth or defining objectives differently.
